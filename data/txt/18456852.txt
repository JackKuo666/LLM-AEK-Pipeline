The gene encoding a novel alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) that belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/
reductase (SDR) superfamily was identiﬁed in the extremely thermophilic, halotolerant gram-negative eubac-
terium Thermus thermophilus HB27. The T. thermophilus ADH gene (adhTt) was heterologously overexpressed
in Escherichia coli, and the protein (ADHTt) was puriﬁed to homogeneity and characterized. ADHTt is a
tetrameric enzyme consisting of identical 26,961-Da subunits composed of 256 amino acids. The enzyme has
remarkable thermophilicity and thermal stability, displaying activity at temperatures up to 73°C and a
30-min half-inactivation temperature of 90°C, as well as good tolerance to common organic solvents. ADHTt
has a strict requirement for NAD(H) as the coenzyme, a preference for reduction of aromatic ketones and
-keto esters, and poor activity on aromatic alcohols and aldehydes. This thermophilic enzyme catalyzes the
following reactions with Prelog speciﬁcity: the reduction of acetophenone, 2,2,2-triﬂuoroacetophenone, -te-
tralone, and -methyl and -ethyl benzoylformates to (S)-()-1-phenylethanol (>99% enantiomeric excess
[ee]), (R)--(triﬂuoromethyl)benzyl alcohol (93% ee), (S)--tetralol (>99% ee), methyl (R)-()-mandelate
(92% ee), and ethyl (R)-()-mandelate (95% ee), respectively, by way of an efﬁcient in situ NADH-recycling
system involving 2-propanol and a second thermophilic ADH. This study further supports the critical role of
the D37 residue in discriminating NAD(H) from NADP(H) in members of the SDR superfamily.
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are of interest for the syn-
thesis of the (S) or (R) enantiomers of alcohols from prochiral
ketones (11). Since their early application in asymmetric syn-
thesis using horse liver and yeast ADHs (13) and Thermoanaero-
bacter brockii ADH (ADHTb) (15), screening efforts have been
directed at various species of microorganisms, which has re-
sulted in new ADHs that have distinctive substrate speciﬁcity,
good efﬁciency, and high enantioselectivity. Representative ex-
amples of enzymes from mesophilic microorganisms are the
NADP-dependent (R)-speciﬁc ADH from Lactobacillus brevis
(RADHLb), which is active on aryl ketones and whose crystal
structure has recently been solved (29), the NAD-dependent
(S)-speciﬁc 1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase from the denitri-
fying bacterium strain EbN1 (PED), which was characterized
and crystallized (10), and the NAD-dependent ADH from
Leifsonia sp. strain S749 (ADHLs), which was found to be
active on (R)-sec alcohols, aryl ketones, aldehydes, and keto
esters and whose gene has recently been cloned for protein
expression in Escherichia coli (12). These enzymes are ho-
motetrameric and belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase/
reductase (SDR) superfamily (14), which is characterized by
250-residue subunits, a Gly motif in the coenzyme-binding
regions, and a catalytic triad formed by the highly conserved
residues Tyr, Lys, and Ser, to which an Asn residue has been
added based on the proposal of Filling et al. (2), which was
recently supported by the RADHLb structure (29). Represen-
tative examples of ADHs from thermophilic microorganisms
are medium-chain enzymes, including ADHTb (18), the ADH
from Bacillus stearothermophilus (ADHBs) (1), and two ar-
chaeal enzymes, the ADH from Aeropyrum pernix (8) and the
well-known ADH from Sulfolobus solfataricus (ADHSs) (27, 6).
The latter is a tetrameric, S-speciﬁc, NAD-dependent zinc
enzyme, which is more active on primary alcohols than on
secondary alcohols and is poorly active on arylketones. By
contrast, the thermophilic S-speciﬁc enzyme ADHTb is NADP
dependent and complements horse liver ADH by preferen-
tially accepting acyclic ketones and secondary alcohols rapidly
(15).
In order to ﬁnd a dehydrogenase/reductase that is both func-
tionally stable and NAD dependent, we focused on the ge-
nomes of thermophilic microorganisms containing genes en-
coding putative ADHs belonging to the SDR superfamily. An
open reading frame coding for a protein belonging to the SDR
superfamily with high sequence identity to an RADHLb open
reading frame was found in the genome of the extremely ther-
mophilic, halotolerant gram-negative eubacterium Thermus
thermophilus HB27 (9). The amino acid sequence (Fig. 1) re-
vealed the presence of an N-terminal nucleotide-binding ﬁn-
gerprint motif, TGXXXGXG; these residues are spaced like
those seen in typical SDRs (14). The protein also possesses an
aspartate residue (D37) located 18 amino acids C terminal of

the third glycine residue; structural studies of the RADHLb
G37D mutant have shown that this residue plays a critical role
in determining the preference of SDRs for NAD(H) (29).
Further evidence of this role is provided by the ADHLs (12)
and PED (10) proteins, which are strictly NAD-dependent
SDRs possessing an aspartate residue at position 37. Thus, the
alignment shown in Fig. 1 suggests that the putative dehydro-
genase/reductase from T. thermophilus (ADHTt) should show a
preference for NAD(H) over NADP(H). This preference,
which is advantageous because of the lower cost of NADH,
and intrinsic protein thermostability are two desirable features
of oxidoreductases used in biotechnology applications (11).
This report describes cloning and heterologous expression of
the T. thermophilus HB27 adhTt gene, which encodes the SDR
ADHTt. The puriﬁed enzyme was characterized in terms of
substrate speciﬁcity, kinetics, and stability. ADHTt was found
to be a thermophilic and thermostable dehydrogenase/reduc-
tase active on both aromatic alcohols and a discrete spectrum
of carbonyl compounds, including substituted benzaldehydes,
aromatic ketones, diketones, and -keto esters. The enantios-
electivity exhibited toward prochiral carbonyl compounds led
us to deﬁne ADHTt as a novel thermophilic SDR that has
Prelog speciﬁcity (25).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals. NAD(P) and NAD(P)H were obtained from AppliChem (Darm-
stadt, Germany). Alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and keto esters were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. MES [2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid] was obtained
from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Other chemicals were grade A
substances obtained from AppliChem. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetraﬂu-
oroborate was a kind gift from S. Cacchi. Recombinant ADHBs was prepared as
previously described (3). Solutions of NADH and NAD were prepared as
previously reported (27). All solutions were made with MilliQ water.
Ampliﬁcation and cloning of the adhTt gene. Chromosomal DNA was ex-
tracted by cesium chloride puriﬁcation as described by Sambrook et al. (28).
Ethidium bromide and cesium chloride were removed by repeated extraction
with isoamyl alcohol and by extensive dialysis against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
1 mM EDTA, respectively. The DNA concentration was determined spectro-
photometrically at 260 nm, and the molecular weight was determined by elec-
trophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel in 90 mM Tris-borate (pH 8.0), 20 mM EDTA,
using DNA molecular size markers. The adhTt gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using
oligonucleotide primers based on the adhTt sequence of T. thermophilus HB27
(GenBank accession no. YP_003977). The following oligonucleotides were used:
5-GGTTGGGGTTCATATGGGCCTTTTCGCTGGCAAAGGGGTGCTG-3
as the forward primer (the NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5-GGTTG
GTTGAATTCCTACACCGGCCGCCCCGCCATCATGAAGCT-3) as the re-
verse primer. The latter oligonucleotide introduced a translational stop following
the last codon of the ADH gene, followed by an EcoRI restriction site (under-
lined). The PCR product was cloned into the expression vector pET29a (Nova-
gen, Madison, WI) and digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes to
create pET29a-ttADH. The insert was sequenced in order to verify that muta-
tions had not been introduced during PCR.
Expression and puriﬁcation of recombinant ADHTt. Recombinant protein was
expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) transformed with the corre-
sponding expression vector. Cultures were grown at 37°C in 2 liters of LB
medium containing 30 g/ml kanamycin. When the A600 of a culture reached 1.4,
protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl--D-1-thiogalactopy-
ranoside (IPTG) to a concentration of 1.0 mM. The bacterial culture was incu-
bated at 37°C for a further 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the
pellet was stored at 20°C until use. The cells obtained from 2 liters of culture
were suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mM phenyl-
methylsulfonyl ﬂuoride and were lysed using a French pressure cell (Aminco Co.,
Silver Spring, MD) at 2,000 lb/in2 (13.8  103 kPa). The lysate was centrifuged,
and the supernatant was incubated in the presence of DNase I (50 g per ml of
solution) and 5 mM MgCl2 for 30 min at 37°C, followed by protamine sulfate (1
mg per ml of solution) at 4°C for 30 min. The nucleic acid fragments were
removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated at 75°C for 15
min. The host protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The superna-

tant was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4) (buffer A)
containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride. The dialyzed solution was ap-
plied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.6 by 12 cm) equilibrated in
buffer A. After washing with 1 bed volume of the same buffer, elution was
performed with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.06 M NaCl (80 ml of each concen-
tration) in buffer A at a ﬂow rate of 60 ml  h1. The active pool was dialyzed
against buffer A, concentrated ﬁvefold with a 30,000-molecular-weight-cutoff
centrifugal ﬁlter device (Millipore), and applied to a Sephadex G-75 column
equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl. The active pool was dialyzed
against buffer A and concentrated to obtain 2.5 mg protein  ml1 as described
previously. ADHTt was stored at 20°C, and there was no loss of activity fol-
lowing several months of storage. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE) and nondenaturing PAGE were carried out by using the
Laemmli method (19), with minor modiﬁcations (27). The subunit molecular
mass was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with a
QSTAR Elite instrument (Applied Biosystems, United States).
Determination of protein concentration. The protein concentration was de-
termined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a
standard (A280 of 1% bovine serum albumin in 50 mM sodium phosphate [pH
7.0]–0.9% NaCl, 6.6).
Enzyme assay. ADHTt activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 65°C by
measuring the change in absorbance at 340 nm of NADH using a Cary 1E
spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier effect-controlled temperature cuvette
holder. The standard assay for the reduction reaction was performed by adding
5 to 25 g of the enzyme to 1 ml of preheated assay mixture containing 20 mM
methyl benzoylformate (MBF) and 0.3 mM NADH in 50 mM potassium phos-
phate (pH 6.0). The standard assay for the oxidation reaction was performed
using a mixture containing 20 mM (S)-()-1-phenylethanol and 3 mM NAD in
100 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 10.5). Screening of the substrates was performed
using 1 ml of assay mixture containing either 20 mM alcohol and 1 mM NAD
in 100 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 10.5), 0.1 M KCl or 5 mM carbonyl compound
and 0.3 mM NADH in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0). The activity of
ADHBs was determined at 60°C using 1 ml of an assay mixture containing either
8 mM alcohol and 18 mM NAD in 200 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) or 8 mM
carbonyl compound and 0.3 mM NADH in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7); 0.5- and
1.0-g aliquots of ADHBs were used for the forward and reverse reactions,
respectively.
One unit of ADHTt and 1 U of ADHBs represented 1 mol of NADH
produced or utilized per min at 65 and 60°C, respectively, on the basis of an
absorption coefﬁcient at 340 nm for NADH of 6.22 mM1.
Effect of pH on activity. The optimum pH values for the reduction and
oxidation reactions were determined at 65°C under the conditions used for MBF
and (S)-()-1-phenylethanol, respectively, except that different buffer systems
were used. The pH was controlled in each assay mixture at 65°C.
Kinetics. The ADHTt kinetic parameters were calculated from measurements
determined in duplicate or triplicate and by analyzing the kinetic results using the
program GraFit (20). The turnover value (kcat, expressed in s1) for ADHTt was
calculated on the basis of a molecular mass of 27 kDa, assuming that the four
subunits are catalytically active.
Thermophilicity and thermal stability. ADHTt was assayed in the temperature
range from 30 to 95°C using standard assay conditions and 25 g of
protein  ml1 of assay mixture. The stability at various temperatures was studied
by incubating 1-mg  ml1 protein samples in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH
6.0) at temperatures between 25 and 95°C for 30 min. Each sample was then
centrifuged at 5°C, and the residual activity was assayed as described above.
Long-term stability was studied by incubating protein samples (0.1 and 1.0
mg  ml1) in 50 mM MES (pH 6.0), 100 mM KCl at 50, 60, and 70°C, and the
residual activity was assayed after 24 h as described above.
Effects of compounds on enzyme activity. The effects of salts, metal ions, ionic
liquids, and chelating agents on ADHTt activity were investigated by assaying the
enzyme in the presence of an appropriate amount of each compound in the
standard assay mixture.
The effects of organic solvents were investigated by measuring the activities in
enzyme samples (0.12 mg  ml1 in 100 mM MES [pH 6.0], 5 mM 2-mercapto-
ethanol, and 100 mM KCl) immediately after the addition of organic solvents at
different concentrations and after incubation for 5 and 24 h at 50 and 60°C. The
percentage of activity for each sample was calculated by comparison with the
value measured prior to incubation. The volume of the solution in a tightly
capped test tube did not change during incubation.
Effects of chelating agents. The effects of chelating agents were studied by
measuring the activities before and after exhaustive dialysis of the enzyme
against buffer A containing 1 mM EDTA and then against buffer A alone. An
aliquot of the dialyzed enzyme was then incubated at 70°C in the absence and
presence of 1 mM EDTA, and the activity was assayed at different times. An-
other aliquot was treated with 0.5 M guanidinium HCl at 30°C in the absence and
presence of 1 mM EDTA or o-phenanthroline, and the activity was assayed at
different times.
Enantioselectivity. The enantioselectivity of ADHTt was determined by exam-
ining the reduction of aryl ketones, bicyclic ketones, and -keto esters using an
NADH regeneration system consisting of ADHBs and 2-propanol. The reaction
mixture contained 1 mM NAD, 20 mM carbonyl compound, 11 U of ADHBs,
260 mM (2%) 2-propanol, and 50 g ADHTt in 1 ml of 100 mM MES (pH 6.0),
5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mM KCl. The reaction mixtures were incu-
bated at 50 and 60°C for different times in a temperature-controlled water bath.
Upon termination of the reaction, each reaction mixture was extracted twice with
ethyl acetate. The enantiomeric excess (ee) of the product and the level of
conversion were determined by gas-liquid chromatography (Agilent 6850) using
a dimethylpentyl, -cyclodextrin MEGA column (25 m; inside diameter, 0.25
mm; Legnano, Italy). The conditions used for 1-phenylethanol and -(triﬂu-
oromethyl)benzyl alcohol were was follows: the oven temperature was increased
from 90°C (initial time, 10 min) to 110°C (ﬁnal time, 5 min) at a rate of
2.5°C/min. The conditions for ethyl and methyl mandelate were as follows: the
oven temperature was increased from 100°C (initial time, 5 min) to 130°C (ﬁnal
time, 5 min) at a rate of 2.5°C/min. And the conditions for -tetralol were as
follows: the oven temperature was increased from 100°C (initial time, 5 min) to
130°C (ﬁnal time, 5 min) at a rate of 2.0°C/min. The conversion yield was
determined on the basis of the peak areas of the carbonyl substrate and alcohol
products obtained in the same gas chromatography (GC) chromatogram.
Size exclusion chromatography. Molecular masses were determined by size
exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham)
equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol containing
0.15 M NaCl at a ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml  min1. The following molecular mass
standards were used for calibration: horse myoglobin (17.5 kDa), chicken ovalbu-
min (44 kDa), beef 	-globin (158 kDa), and tyroglobulin (670 kDa) from Bio-
Rad. In order to calculate the distribution coefﬁcient, the void and total volumes
of the column were determined with tryptophan and blue dextran.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Expression and protein puriﬁcation. Analysis of the T. ther-
mophilus genome (9) for genes encoding short-chain ADHs
resulted in identiﬁcation of a putative oxidoreductase gene.
Based both on the presence of an aspartic residue at position
37 (Fig. 1) determined by the multiple-sequence alignment
analysis of Kallberg et al. (14) and on kinetic and structural
studies of the L. brevis ADH G37D mutant (29), the oxi-
doreductase protein was expected to be NAD dependent and
was designated ADHTt. ADHTt is a 26,961.1-Da protein whose
sequence showed the highest levels of identity to three typical
SDRs, ADHLs (38% identity), RADHLb (34% identity), and
PED (32% identity) (Fig. 1). The adhTt gene was successfully
expressed in E. coli cells, which yielded an active enzyme ac-
counting for more than 7.5% of the total protein in the cell
extract (Table 1). Host protein precipitation at 75°C was the
most effective puriﬁcation step. The enzyme was enriched 11-
fold with a 47% yield and was deemed homogeneous by de-
naturing and nondenaturing PAGE (data not shown).

sulted in a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of
26 kDa. Gel ﬁltration performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer
(pH 8.5), 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol containing 0.15 M NaCl
yielded a proﬁle consisting of a single peak corresponding to a
molecular mass of 71 kDa. The corresponding value was
105 kDa when the same buffer containing 25 mM NaCl was
used. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that
ADHTt has a tetrameric structure, which adopts a more com-
pact structure in the presence of a relatively high salt concen-
tration, resulting in greater permeation into the packing pores
of the gel matrix. The molecular mass of the subunit deter-
mined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis
was 26,830.0 Da (average mass), in agreement with the theo-
retical value of the sequence lacking the N-terminal methio-
nine.
Optimal pH and thermophilicity. Figure 2 shows the pH
dependence of ADHTt in the reduction and oxidation reaction
and the pH dependence of ADHBs in the oxidation reaction
alone. The ADHTt activity was found to be dependent on the
pH during the reduction reaction, and there was a narrow peak
of maximum activity at approximately pH 6.0. The oxidation
reaction showed a less marked dependence on pH, and there
was a broad peak with maximum activity at around pH 10.0.
The pH proﬁle of ADHBs (Fig. 2) shows that the activity on
2-propanol at pH 6.0 is about 30% of the optimal activity at pH
9 and is comparable to the activity of ADHTt in the reduction
reaction. The data suggest that pH could control both the
ADHTt activity for the desired reduction reaction and the
ADHBs activity in NADH recycling, depending on the oxida-
tion of 2-propanol.
The effect of temperature on ADHTt activity is shown in Fig.
3. The reaction rate increases up to a temperature of about
73°C and then decreases rapidly due to thermal inactivation.
This optimal temperature is comparable to those of other
ADHs from thermophilic organisms, such as ADHSs (88°C)
(27), ADHTb (85°C) (18), and ADHBs (65°C) (7), which are
medium-chain, zinc-containing ADHs, and lower than that of
the recently described Pyrococcus furiosus NAD(P)H-depen-
dent ADH that belongs to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily
(100°C) (22). The activation energy for oxidation is 62.9 
 2.6
kJ mol1, which is slightly higher than that determined for
ADHBs (52.6 kJ mol1) (data not shown) or ADHSs (46.7 kJ
mol1) (27) and 1.5-fold lower than that reported for ADHTb
(94.1 kJ mol1) (18).
Coenzyme and substrate speciﬁcity. The enzyme showed no
activity with NADP(H) and full activity with NAD(H). This
preference further supports the evidence that an aspartate
residue at position 37 of an SDR enzyme plays a critical role in
discriminating NAD(H) from NADP(H) (2, 14). The speciﬁc-
ity of ADHTt for various alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones was
examined (Tables 2 and 3). The enzyme showed no activity on
aliphatic linear, branched, and cyclic alcohols except for a
discrete activity on cyclohexanol (Table 2). Benzyl alcohol and
4-methyl- and 4-bromo-benzyl alcohols were found not to be
substrates. In contrast, in view of the greater inﬂuence that the
strong electron-donating methoxy group exerts in the para and
ortho positions of the benzene ring compared with the meta
position, the three methoxy-substituted benzyl alcohols were
found to be highly active substrates. (S)-()-1-Phenylethanol
was also found to be an active substrate, whereas the S and R
enantiomers of -(triﬂuoromethyl)benzyl alcohol and methyl
and ethyl mandelates showed no apparent activity with
ADHTt. Moreover, the activity on (
)-1-phenyl-1-propanol
was similar to that observed for racemic 1-phenylethanol,
whereas the activities on 1-(4-ﬂuorophenyl)ethanol, 1-(4-
chlorophenyl)ethanol, and trans-cinnamyl alcohol were 45, 26,
FIG. 2. ADHTt activity as a function of pH in the reduction (main
plot) and oxidation (inset) reactions and ADHBs activity as a function
of pH in the oxidation reaction (main plot). The following 50 mM
buffer solutions containing 0.1 M KCl were used: sodium acetate (E),
sodium phosphate (F), MES (), and Tris-HCl (Œ) in the reduction
reaction and sodium phosphate (), glycine-NaOH (}), and disodium
phosphate-NaOH () in the oxidation reaction. The mixture for the
reduction reaction contained 20 mM methyl benzoylformate and 0.3
mM NADH, and the mixture for the oxidation reaction contained 20
mM (S)-()-1-phenylethanol and 3 mM NAD. The activity of the
ADHBs oxidation reaction was measured in the following 50 mM
buffer solutions containing 0.1 M KCl: MES (‚), Tris-HCl (f), and
glycine-NaOH (). The mixture consisted of 260 mM 2-propanol and
18 mM NAD. The assays were performed under the conditions de-
scribed in Materials and Methods. The kcat values for ADHBs were
calculated on the basis of the monomer molecular mass (32.25 kDa).
FIG. 3. Temperature dependence of the ADHTt activity. The assay
was carried out as described in Materials and Methods, using 2,2,2-
triﬂuoroacetophenone as the substrate. The inset shows the Arrhenius
plot for the same data. The activation energy was 62.9 
 2.6 kJ mol1.
The kcat data for temperatures higher than 65°C were corrected for the
change in optical density at 340 nm due to NADH heat lability.

branched, and cyclic ketones. However, the enzyme showed a
high reduction rate with halogenated aryl ketones, such as
2,2,2-triﬂuoroacetophenone, 2-chloroacetophenone, and 4-
chlorobutyrophenone, and with aryl diketones, such as 1-phe-
nyl-1,2-propanedione, although it was not active on benzil (di-
phenylethanedione) (Table 3). Although the CF3 group is
sterically more demanding than the CH3 group (van der Waals
volumes, 42.7 and 24.5 Å3, respectively [30]), the electron-
withdrawing character of ﬂuorine favors hydride transfer, in-
ductively decreasing the electron density at the acceptor car-
bon, C-1. This electronic factor accounts for the apparent
catalytic inactivity observed with the corresponding (S)--(tri-
ﬂuoromethyl)benzyl alcohol compared to the high activity ob-
served with the nonhalogenated alcohol (S)-()-1-phenyletha-
nol (Table 2).
Interestingly, ADHTt proved to be very effective in reducing
aryl -keto esters, although it was not active on aliphatic
-keto esters and aryl -keto esters. The evidence presented
here shows that ADHTt is a strictly NAD(H)-dependent oxi-
doreductase that has discrete substrate speciﬁcity. Thus,
ADHTt is distinct from the three SDR superfamily mesophilic,
tetrameric ADHs to which it shows high sequence similarity in
speciﬁc regions throughout the primary structure (i.e., ADHLs,
RADHLb, and PED) and which are active on a variety of
aliphatic as well as aromatic alcohols ketones, diketones, and
keto esters (Fig. 1).
Kinetic studies. The kinetic parameters of ADHTt deter-
mined for the most active substrates are shown in Table 4.
Based on the speciﬁcity constant (kcat/Km), this enzyme shows
the greatest preference for ethyl benzoylformate compared
with MBF, 3-methoxybenzaldehyde, 2,2,2-triﬂuoroacetophe-
none, and 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione in the reduction reaction
and relatively lower preference for (S)-()-1-indanol and (S)-
()--tetralol in the oxidation reaction. Moreover, the kcat and
kcat/Km values are considerably higher for NADH than for
NAD. These results suggest that the enzyme is S stereospe-
ciﬁc and that the physiological direction of the catalytic reac-
tion is reduction rather than oxidation. However, the natural
substrate and function of ADHTt are unknown. Quintela and
coworkers (26) highlighted the presence of muropeptides with
phenylacetic acid residues as a distinctive feature of T. ther-
mophilus peptidoglycan. It is tempting to speculate that
ADHTt may play a role in a hypothetical phenylacetate syn-
thesis via benzoylformate to mandelate.
It is noteworthy that the speciﬁc activity of ADHTt (60 and
210 U/mg with 2,2,2-triﬂuoroacetophenone and MBF, respec-
tively) is comparable to the speciﬁc activities of ADHLs (77
U/mg with 2,2,2-triﬂuoroacetophenone) (12), ADHTb (30 to 90
U/mg with the best substrates) (11), and RADHLb (450 U/mg
with acetophenone) (11) and higher than the speciﬁc activity of
ADHSs (5.5 U/mg with benzyl alcohol) (27).
Thermal stability. The thermal stability of ADHTt was de-
termined by measuring the residual enzymatic activity after 30
min of incubation over a temperature range from 25 to 95°C.
ADHTt was shown to be quite stable up to a temperature of
80°C, above which its activity decreased abruptly, and the tem-
perature at which there was 50% inactivation after 30 min of
incubation was 90°C (data not shown). In 0.1-mg ml1 pro-
tein samples, the residual activities measured after 24 h of
incubation at 50, 60, and 70°C were 142, 134, and 107%, re-
spectively; the residual activities in 1.0-mg ml1 samples were
97, 105, and 94% for the same temperatures.
Effects of various compounds. The effects of salts, ions, and
reagents on ADHTt activity were studied by adding each com-
pound to the standard assay mixture containing 50 mM Tris-
HCl buffer (pH 7.0) (Table 5). The chlorides of Li, Na, and
K activated the enzyme, whereas those of Ca2 and Mg2
caused partial inactivation. Iodoacetate did not affect the ac-
tivity, indicating that the only Cys residue in the monomer,
C36, which is adjacent to the functionally important residue
D37 (Fig. 1), may not have an essential role, although it is

susceptible to reactions with heavy metal ions, such as Cu2
and Hg2 (Table 5).
The presence of metal-chelating agents did not affect the
enzyme activity, suggesting that either the protein does not
require metals for activity or the chelating molecule was not
able to remove the metals under the assay conditions. Further-
more, the enzyme showed no loss of activity following exhaus-
tive dialysis against EDTA. The EDTA-dialyzed enzyme
turned out to be quite stable at 70°C for 4 h, both in the
absence and in the presence of EDTA or o-phenanthroline.
Moreover, incubation of the dialyzed enzyme at 30°C for 6 h in
the presence of a low concentration of denaturant (0.5 M
guanidinium HCl) resulted in 20% inactivation in the absence
and presence of EDTA or o-phenanthroline added at millimo-
lar concentrations (data not shown). These results indicate that
ADHTt does not require metals for activity or for structural
stabilization; although this is usual for the typically nonmetal
SDR enzymes, the more classical RADHLb-type ADHs show
strong Mg2 dependence (23). The 65% inactivation observed
with the ionic liquid was presumably due to competition of the
BF4
 ion with the coenzyme phosphate moiety for the anion
binding site of the enzyme.
Stability in organic solvents. The effects of common organic
solvents, such as methanol, 2-propanol, acetonitrile, dioxane,
and ethyl acetate, on ADHTt were investigated at two different
times and at two different temperatures (Fig. 4). Signiﬁcant
increases in enzyme activity occurred after incubation in aque-
ous buffer (the values were 130 to 140% of the values prior to
incubation) and after incubation in the presence of all the
solvents tested. The enzyme activities ranged from 130% of the
initial value when 5% acetonitrile was included at 50°C to over
200% of the initial value with 10% 2-propanol at 60°C.
The presence of 10% methanol, 2-propanol, acetonitrile,
dioxane, ethyl acetate, 1-propanol, and n-hexane in samples of
ADHTt incubated for 65 h at 25°C resulted in activities that
were 172, 110, 167, 160, 115, 173, and 182%, respectively, of
the initial activity measured prior to incubation, whereas the
activity of the control remained unchanged. Furthermore,
standard assays performed in the presence of 0.01 to 0.5%
2-propanol resulted in no change in activity, suggesting that the
enhancement of activity was not due to an immediate effect of
solvent on the protein structure. Previous papers have de-
scribed the activation of thermophilic enzymes by loosening of
their rigid structure in the presence of protein perturbants (4,
21). To account for the observed enhancement of ADHTt activity,
it is proposed that the organic solvent induces a conformational
change in the protein molecule to a more relaxed and ﬂexible
conformation that is optimal for activity. Analogously, the acti-
vating effect following heating of ADHTt in aqueous buffer at 50
and 60°C for a long time (Fig. 4) may be due to partial loosening
of the overall structure, inducing increased ﬂexibility at the active
site and consequently increased turnover.
Enantioselectivity. The enantioselectivity of ADHTt was
tested using acetophenone, 2,2,2-triﬂuoroacetophenone, -
methyl and -ethyl benzoylformates, -tetralone, and 1-in-
danone as substrates and an efﬁcient NADH regeneration sys-
tem (Fig. 5) consisting of Zn-containing, homotetrameric
ADH obtained from the moderately thermophilic bacterium
Bacillus stearothermophilus strain LLD-R (ADHBs) (7). This

(0.12 mg ml1) were incubated at 50°C (open and cross-hatched bars)
and 60°C (gray and black bars) in the absence and presence of the
organic solvents at the indicated concentrations, and assays were per-
formed after 5 h (open and gray bars) and 24 h (cross-hatched and
black bars). The activity assays were performed as described in Mate-
rials and Methods using ethyl benzoylformate as the substrate. The
data obtained in the absence and presence of organic solvents are
expressed as percentages of activity relative to the value determined
prior to incubation.

ADH has been successfully used in hydrogen tunneling effect
studies for a sizeable temperature range (17), as well as in
structural and molecular dynamic studies (1, 31); it is NAD(H)
dependent and is active mainly on aliphatic and aromatic pri-
mary and secondary alcohols and aldehydes (7) but not on
aliphatic and aromatic ketones or on the carbonyl substrates of
ADHTt and corresponding alcohols (data not shown). Since
2-propanol is not a substrate of ADHTt, it may be a suitable
substrate for ADHBs in NADH recycling, as well as for use as
a cosolvent. The experimental conditions, including buffer, pH,
temperature, and reaction time, were chosen to optimize pro-
ductivity. Figure 2 shows that MES buffer (pH 6.0) and 60°C
were the optimal pH and temperature conditions for catalysis
by the two enzymes.
Conversion experiments were carried out at 50 and 60°C,
and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 1, 3, 6, and 24 h.
Figure 6 shows that the levels of conversion of 2,2,2-triﬂuoro-
acetophenone were 20 and 40% in 1 h at 50 and 60°C, respec-
tively, approximating 100% in 6 h at both temperatures.
ADHTt preferably reduced this arylketone to (R)--(triﬂu-
oromethyl)benzyl alcohol with ee of 90 and 93% at 60 and
50°C, respectively, after 3 h of incubation. However, reaction
times as long as 24 h did not improve the yield or ee of the
biotransformation (Fig. 6). MBF was reduced by ADHTt to
methyl (R)-()-mandelate with 18, 91, and 99% conversion at
50°C and with 38, 83, and 98% conversion at 60°C after 1, 6,
and 24 h, respectively. The highest ee (92%) was observed
after 6 h of incubation at 50°C, whereas the ee were 91% at
60°C after 6 h and 89 and 91% at 50 and 60°C, respectively,
after 24 h of incubation. Figure 7 shows the results of a GC
analysis of the reduction of MBF following 6 h of incubation at
50°C. Similarly, the reaction with ethyl benzoylformate per-
formed for 6 h at 50°C yielded ethyl (R)-()-mandelate with a
level of conversion of 90% and an ee of 95%. Acetophenone
was reduced to (S)-1-phenylethanol following a 6-h reaction at
50°C with a level of conversion of 70% and an ee of 99%,
despite the apparent inactivity under different assay conditions
(Table 3). This result is remarkable since it shows that the
devised NADH regeneration system was able to drive a ther-
modynamically unfavorable transformation. Analogously, 1-in-
danone and -tetralone (data not shown) were reduced to the
corresponding (S) alcohols following a 6-h reaction at 50°C,
with levels of conversion of 40 and 18%, respectively, and an ee
of almost 99%. The results are summarized in Table 6. On the
whole, the enantioselectivity data indicate that the hydride ion
of NADH is transferred to the re face of the carbonyl of
acetophenone, 2,2,2-triﬂuoroacetophenone, and bicyclic ke-
tones, as well as that of -methyl and -ethyl benzoylformates,
suggesting that ADHTt exhibits Prelog speciﬁcity (25). The ee
and yield values obtained for the conversion of the haloge-
nated and nonhalogenated acetophenones are comparable to
the values for the SDRs ADHLs (12) and RADHLb (29), both
of which possess anti-Prelog selectivity. The activation of
ADHTt by 10% (vol/vol) n-hexane proves the sturdiness of the
enzyme and suggests promising applications for conversion of
poorly water-soluble prochiral substrates at higher concentra-
tions in a biphasic reaction medium. Investigations with water-
immiscible organic solvents are in progress to assess the appli-
cability of the reaction system for preparative asymmetric
synthesis.
It is noteworthy that the optically active alcohols produced
are used as chiral building blocks in organic synthesis. O-
protected methyl (R)-()-mandelate is used as an intermedi-
ate for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals (16, 24), and optically
pure triﬂuoromethyl-substituted benzyl alcohols are important

out at 50°C (circles) and 60°C (triangles) as described in Materials and
Methods. The reactions were stopped by addition of ethyl acetate at
the times indicated. The dried extracts were analyzed by chiral GC,
and the relative conversion was calculated by dividing the area of
alcohol products by the total area.

Closing remarks. The gene encoding a novel ADH from T.
thermophilus was successfully expressed in E. coli, and the
puriﬁed enzyme was shown to possess remarkable thermophi-
licity, thermal resistance, and tolerance to common organic
solvents. ADHTt exhibits Prelog speciﬁcity and high enantios-
electivity with a discrete spectrum of aromatic carbonyl sub-
strates of interest. Moreover, ADHTt has many advantages
with regard to its preparative application, including ease of
puriﬁcation, long-term stability, and absolute preference for
NAD(H), which can be efﬁciently regenerated via a thermo-
philic bacillus ADH (ADHBs) in a bioconversion process based
on coenzyme recycling. ADHTt and ADHBs are particularly
amenable to coupling in an efﬁcient synthetic reaction as they
possess good functional stability in the presence of 2-propanol
at relatively elevated temperatures and only the coenzyme is a
cosubstrate. Moreover, the importance of the critical role of
the D37 residue mentioned above in SDRs in discriminating
NAD(H) from NADP(H) is further supported by the results of
this study.
