Bacterial cytidine monophosphate (CMP) kinases are characterised by an
insert enlarging their CMP binding domain, and by their particular sub-
strate speci®city. Thus, both CMP and 20-deoxy-CMP (dCMP) are good
phosphate acceptors for the CMP kinase from Escherichia coli (E. coli
CMPK),
whereas
eukaryotic
UMP/CMP
kinases
phosphorylate
the
deoxynucleotides with very low ef®ciency. Four crystal structures of
E. coli CMPK complexed with nucleoside monophosphates differing in
their sugar moiety were solved. Both structures with CMP or dCMP
show interactions with the pentose that were not described so far. These
interactions are lost with the poorer substrates AraCMP and 20,30-
dideoxy-CMP. Comparison of all four structures shows that the pentose
hydroxyls
are
involved
in
ligand-induced
movements
of
enzyme
domains. It also gives a structural basis of the mechanism by which
either ribose or deoxyribose can be accommodated. In parallel, for the
four nucleotides the kinetic results of the wild-type enzyme and of three
structure-based variants are presented. The phosphorylation rate is sig-
ni®cantly decreased when either of the two pentose interacting residues
is mutated. One of these is an arginine that is highly conserved in all
known nucleoside monophosphate kinases. In contrast, the other residue,
Asp185, is typical of bacterial CMP kinases. It interacts with Ser101, the
only residue conserved in all CMP binding domain inserts. Mutating
Ser101 reduces CMP phosphorylation only moderately, but dramatically
reduces dCMP phosphorylation. This is the ®rst experimental evidence of
a catalytic role involving the characteristic insert of bacterial CMP
kinases. Furthermore, this role concerns only dCMP phosphorylation, a
feature of this family of enzymes.

Introduction
Nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases are
key enzymes in the metabolism of nucleotides.
They catalyse the reversible transfer of a g phos-
phoryl group from a nucleoside triphosphate to a
particular nucleoside monophosphate.1 Cytidine
monophosphate kinase from Escherichia coli (E. coli
CMPK), a monomer of 227 residues, speci®cally
phosphorylates CMP (or dCMP), using ATP as the
preferred
phosphoryl
donor,
according
to
the
scheme:

The CDP and 20-deoxy-CDP produced are further
phosphorylated to produce CTP and 20-deoxy-CTP,
precursors of the major biological molecules RNA,
DNA, and phospholipids.
Concerning the enzymes involved in the phos-
phorylation
of
pyrimidine
nucleoside
mono-
phosphates, three major differences are observed
between bacteria and eukaryotes.
Firstly, in eukaryotes a single enzyme phos-
phorylates UMP and CMP with similar ef®ciency.
Conversely, bacterial CMP kinases phosphorylate
UMP with very low rates, this role being assigned
to distinct UMP kinases.
Secondly, E. coli CMPK phosphorylates dCMP
nearly as well as it does CMP. This is in contrast to
eukaryotic UMP/CMP kinases, which phosphory-
late the corresponding deoxynucleotides with very
low ef®ciency.2 Mutants of E. coli devoid of CMP
kinase activity have a level of CTP comparable to
that
found
in
wild-type
bacteria,
due
to
the
enzyme
CTP
synthetase
which
produces
CTP
through UTP amination. In contrast, the dCTP
pool and the rate of DNA replication are reduced
in
the
mutants:
ribonucleoside
diphosphate
reductase, which catalyses the formation of 20-
deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates from the corre-
sponding ribonucleotides, cannot fully compensate
for the lack of E. coli CMPK.3 Therefore, phos-
phorylation of dCMP appears as one of the main
roles of CMP kinase in E. coli.
Thirdly, the kinetic differences between eukary-
otic UMP/CMP kinases and bacterial CMP kinases
are echoed by sequence differences. All known
NMP kinases have an overall well-conserved fold
with three domains:4,5 the CORE domain, contain-
ing
a
®ve-stranded
parallel
b-sheet;
the
LID
domain, which like a lid closes the active site upon
binding of the phosphate donor ATP; the NMP
binding domain, which closes the active site upon
binding of the phosphate acceptor. Classically,
NMP kinases are divided into short forms, includ-
ing
eukaryotic
UMP/CMP
kinases,
and
long
forms.
The
latter
group
consists
of
adenylate
kinases with an insertion of around 27 residues
into the LID domain. Bacterial CMP kinases rep-
resent a third distinct family of NMP kinases, as
they possess a short LID domain but have an inser-
tion of around 40 residues into their NMP binding
domain (NMPb-insert).
We previously solved the ®rst structure of a bac-
terial CMP kinase, that of E. coli, either alone or in
complex with CDP.6 Binding of CDP induces a
movement of the NMP-binding domain which is
different from that of the two structurally charac-
terised eukaryotic UMP/CMP kinases: those from
yeast7 and from amoeba.8 The CDP-CMPK struc-
ture explained the speci®city of the E. coli enzyme
for CMP versus UMP, but neither its particular abil-
ity to phosphorylate dCMP nor the potential role
of the NMPb-insert.
To further investigate the phosphorylation of
deoxynucleotides by E. coli CMPK, we solved its
structure in complex with the two natural sub-
strates CMP and dCMP. Then, we looked at the
complexes with two nucleotide analogues modi®ed
on the pentose moiety, cytosine b-D-arabinofurano-
side-50-monophosphate
(AraCMP)
and
20,30-
dideoxy-CMP (ddCMP), which are poorer sub-
strates.
In addition, we tested by site-directed mutagen-
esis
the
importance
of
three
residues
which,
according to crystal structure analysis, were either
directly interacting with the pentose in the com-
plexes with CMP or dCMP, or H-bonded to such
an interacting residue. The catalytic ef®ciencies of
the
three
resulting
variants
for
CMP,
dCMP,
AraCMP and ddCMP are interpreted in relation
to
crystal
structures.
The
conservation
among
bacterial CMP kinases of the mutated residues is
discussed.
Results
Comparison of E. coli CMPK structures
complexed either with the substrate CMP or
the product CDP
Overall, the CMP-CMPK structure (Figure 1(a))
is the same as that previously published in com-
plex with CDP. The CORE domain, which contains
®ve parallel b strands connected by a helices, and
the short LID domain are similar to those of short
NMP kinases. The NMP binding domain contains
a 40-residue insert (blue trace, Leu63 to Gln102 in
E. coli CMPK) typical of bacterial CMP kinases:
this insert contains three antiparallel b strands and
two a helices, the longest one being by far a5
(labelled on Figure 1(b)). When CMP or CDP is
bound, the helical part of the NMPb-insert moves
closer to the ligand in an induced-®t movement.
A comparison of the active sites with CMP and
CDP (Figure 2, top) indicates that the same resi-
dues interact with the a phosphate or the cytosine
of the two nucleotides. Residues that are H-bonded
to the a phosphate (Arg41, Arg131) are conserved
in all known NMP kinases, whereas most residues
H-bonded
to
the
cytosine
(Asp132,
Arg110,
Arg188) are conserved only in bacterial CMP
kinases (see ref.2 for an alignment of amino acid
sequences from different NMP kinases with E. coli
CMPK).
However, the interactions with the sugar moiety
are quite different in the two complexes. With CDP
the only direct polar interaction between the E. coli
enzyme and the ribose is the hydrogen bond invol-
ving the 20-hydroxyl group. Whereas the carboxy-
late group of Asp185 interacts only with the 20-OH
of CDP, it is H-bonded to the two hydroxyl groups
of the CMP ribose. The other important difference
with
CDP-CMPK
concerns
Arg181,
which
is
H-bonded to both the 30-OH and the a phosphate
of CMP. In the presence of CDP the side-chain of
this arginine points away from the nucleotide.

Sugar Speci®city of Escherichia coli CMP Kinase
The conformation of the ribose is C30-endo in
CMP-CMPK crystals (C30 for green models is over
the sugar ring in the orientation of Figure 1(c)), as
opposed to C20-endo in CDP-CMPK. C30-endo and
C20-endo conformations, the two principal sugar
puckering modes, are in rapid equilibrium in
solution.9 The C30-endo conformation preferred for
the bound CMP brings the 30-OH closer to Arg181
and Asp185. This allows a bidentate interaction of
the carboxylate of Asp185 with both hydroxyls of
the ribose.
The structure of E. coli CMPK complexed
with dCMP
The crystal structure with dCMP shows different
closures of helices a5 and a8
Both CMP-CMPK and dCMP-CMPK crystals
belong to the P212121 space group, with very simi-
lar unit cells (Table 1), and two molecules per
asymmetric unit. The two molecules of the asym-
metric unit are essentially identical in the structure
with CMP (Figure 1(b), green models), in contrast
to the structure with dCMP: the calculated root
mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for Ca atoms
between the two molecules of an asymmetric unit
is 0.89 A
Ê with dCMP, and only 0.45 A
Ê with CMP.
With dCMP, most of the backbone remains very
similar, but signi®cant variations are observed for
helices a8 (Phe171 to Asn187) and to a lesser extent
a5 (Arg92 to Ala104). These are the two helices
that move towards each other to close the cleft
when a nucleotide binds, like two opposite jaws.
For the sake of clarity, we will call molecule A of
an asymmetric unit that which has the narrower
cleft, and molecule B the more open one. The
dCMP-CMPK structure residues of a5 and a8
involved in crystal contacts are identical for both
molecules of an asymmetric unit. Thus, the differ-
ences observed between molecules A and B are not
an artefact due to a particular crystal packing in
this
region.

further from dCMP (the calculated r.m.s.d. for a8
between molecules A and B is 2.11 A
Ê with dCMP,
whereas it is only 0.31 A
Ê with CMP). The right
jaw, helix a5 from the NMPb-insert, also moves
further from dCMP (r.m.s.d. for a5 is 1.48 A
Ê with
dCMP, and 0.49 A
Ê with CMP).
With dCMP, only the molecule A makes polar
interactions like those with CMP
The bottom of Figure 2 shows the enzyme inter-
actions with dCMP in molecules A and B. In mol-
ecule A, Arg181 interacts with the a phosphate
and the 30-OH as it does with CMP, although the
position of the guanidinium group is different. As
is the case with CMP, the side-chain of Asp185
interacts with the 30-OH and with Ser101. Thus, the
same residues interact with the ribose and the
deoxyribose. The only difference is that the carbox-
ylate of Asp185 no longer has the 20-OH partner
for hydrogen bonding.
In molecule B with dCMP, Arg181 and Asp185
from a8 do not interact anymore with the 30-OH,
and Arg188, a residue adjacent to a8, does not
interact with the cytosine. This is consistent with
the fact that a8 is further from dCMP than in mol-
ecule A. Similarly, the remoteness of a5 from
dCMP is probably related to the loss of interaction
between the side-chains of Ser101 from a5 and
Asp185 from a8. However, most polar interactions
of the enzyme with the a phosphate or the cytosine
from the nucleotide substrate are conserved in all
structures with CDP, CMP and dCMP. Thus, in the
relatively more open conformation of molecule B,
dCMP remains close to the position observed in
molecule A, except that it penetrates less deeply
into the binding cleft (see Figure 1(b)).
Another difference between molecules A and B
is the sugar conformation (see Figure 1(c)). It is
C30-endo in A, as was the case for CMP, whereas it
is C20-endo in B (pink model), as with CDP. As a

smaller in order to allow visualisation of the distant residues Arg181 and Asp185. Nucleotides have yellow sticks.
Enzyme residues H-bonded to the cytosine or the a phosphate of the nucleotides are simply labelled, as they are
essentially comparable in all structures. Conversely, side-chains of residues that can be H-bonded to the pentose are

CDP-CMPK. The orientation, chosen to avoid overlapping of protein residues with bound ligands, differs from those
of Figure 1.

result, the 30-OH from the pentose has very differ-
ent orientations in molecules A and B.
Structures with pentose modified
nucleotide analogues
Common features of both structures with AraCMP
or ddCMP
To further investigate the role of the pentose
hydroxyls, we solved the crystal structures of
E. coli CMPK with the monophosphates of two
nucleoside analogues that have altered af®nities
for the enzyme (Table 1): aracytidine (Cytarabine),
a drug used in cancer chemotherapy, and 20,30-
dideoxy-cytidine
(ddC),
used
against
Human
Immunode®ciency Virus.
As was the case with dCMP, the asymmetric
unit of both crystals contains two molecules which
are rather different (r.m.s.d. between Ca positions:
0.73 A
Ê for AraCMP, 0.78 A
Ê for ddCMP). Besides,
with AraCMP and ddCMP the cleft is more widely
open than is the case with CMP.
Figure 3 shows the enzyme-nucleotide polar
interactions in molecules A and B for both ana-
logues, and the omit maps of the substrates.
Despite their high Km, the electron densities are
very clear. At ®rst sight, the two nucleotide ana-
logues have structures that are close to those of the
natural substrates. Thus, in molecules A the resi-
dues that interact with the a phosphate and with
the cytosine of AraCMP or ddCMP also interact
with CDP, CMP and dCMP (molecule A). Never-
theless, in the presence of the analogues several
interactions with the enzyme are lost: no hydrogen
bond connects the a phosphate to Arg181. Then, in
molecules B Arg188 does not interact with the
bound NMP, as is the case in dCMP (molecule B),
but in addition Arg131 is no longer H-bonded to
the a phosphate. Compared to the natural sub-
strates CMP and dCMP, the weaker polar inter-
actions of the analogues with the enzyme easily
explain their relatively low af®nity.
Changing the orientation of the 2 0-OH:
characteristics of the AraCMP-CMPK structure
AraCMP, an arabinonucleotide, differs from its
ribo analogue in the altered con®guration at C20:
the 20-hydroxyl is cis-oriented to the glycosyl C10-N
bond. Whereas the absence of the 20-OH in dCMP
is of little consequence on the phoshorylation rate,

its inversion in AraCMP has a greater effect: kcat/
Km is ten times lower than with dCMP (Table 2). In
the crystal structure, for both molecules A and B
the 20-OH typical of AraCMP establishes an hydro-
gen bond with Asp185. This interaction requires
that Asp185 side-chain moves so that it no longer
interacts with the 30-OH and Ser101. Thus the
bidentate interaction observed with CMP is lost.
However, the 30-OH orientation remains close to
those observed with the natural substrates CMP
and dCMP.

extremely poor substrate of the wild-type E. coli
CMPK (Table 2). The kcat/Km value for ddCMP is
at least 10,000 times lower than for dCMP.
Concerning the opening of the a5 and a8 jaws,
conformations with ddCMP are close to those with
dCMP: for both deoxynucleotides, molecule B is
signi®cantly more open than molecule A (not
shown).
Concerning
the
enzyme-ligand
inter-
actions (Figure 3, bottom), the absence of the 30-
OH results in the loss of the polar interaction
between Arg181 and the a phosphate observed
with dCMP. For the particular case of molecule B,
the interaction with Asp132 is lost.
Site-directed mutagenesis
Substitution of residues directly interacting with the
sugar moiety: kinetic parameters of the D185A
and R181M variants
As the pentose makes direct interactions with
Asp185 in the CDP, CMP, dCMP (molecule A) and
AraCMP complexes, and with Arg181 for CMP
and dCMP(A), we mutated these two positions.
The mid-point of thermal denaturation (tm) for
both variants is close to that of the wild-type
enzyme, suggesting that these mutations do not
alter the protein structure. Table 2 gives the kinetic
parameters of the resulting enzymes. Also shown
are those of the wild-type enzyme, which phos-
phorylates dCMP nearly as well as CMP. For
nucleotide analogues, both Km values of the wild-
type enzyme are at least ten times as high as that
for CMP, but whereas kcat for AraCMP remains
half that with CMP, it is drastically reduced with
ddCMP (more than 2000 times lower).
Concerning the natural nucleotides CMP and
dCMP, the D185A variant has higher Km values
than the wild-type enzyme, but the difference is at
most one order of magnitude. On the other hand,
the kcat of this variant is reduced by a factor of 400
with CMP, and 1500 with dCMP. Mutation R181M
has the same results concerning Km values; the
results concerning kcat values are similar, although
less pronounced, than for mutation D185A. On the
whole, both mutations exhibit dramatic conse-
quences on kcat/Km towards CMP and dCMP (the

Sugar Speci®city of Escherichia coli CMP Kinase

decrease is about 5000-fold for D185A, and 500-
fold for R181M).
Concerning the nucleotide analogues ddCMP
and AraCMP, the Km values do not vary much
when the two mutants and the wild-type enzyme
are compared. kcat drops for AraCMP. For ddCMP
the low kcat value of the wild-type enzyme does
not change much in the mutants.
The S101A mutant: the collapse of dCMP
phosphorylation is the first evidence of a catalytic
role played by the insert
Asp185, which is essential for the activity of
E. coli CMPK, is H-bonded to Ser101 in both CMP-
CMPK and dCMP-CMPK (molecule A) structures
(Figure 2). Moreover, as indicated in Figure 4,
Ser101 is the only strictly conserved amino acid
residue in the homologous inserts from the 27
different bacterial species identi®ed by BLAST.10
We substituted this residue with an alanine and
examined the catalytic properties of the modi®ed
protein. The resulting variant has a tm close to that
of the wild-type enzyme.
The kinetic parameters of this variant differ from
those of D185A and R181M mutants. Thus, the
S101A variant phosphorylates CMP much like the
wild-type enzyme, whereas the three other sub-
strates show signi®cantly decreased reaction rates.
The contrast is especially apparent when CMP and
dCMP are compared: kcat/Km for CMP is four
times lower than with the wild-type enzyme,
whereas it is 200 times lower for dCMP. As was
the case for the variant D185A, the decrease is
mainly due to a decrease in kcat.
Therefore, Ser101 is involved in dCMP phos-
phorylation, which is a special feature of bacterial
CMP kinases. The effect of the S101A substitution
reported here is the ®rst published evidence of an
active contribution of the NMPb-insert from bac-
terial CMP kinases in catalysis.
Discussion
Contribution of the pentose in induced-fit
movements of the enzyme
In a previous paper we discussed the domain
movements induced by CDP binding to E. coli
CMPK.6 Structure comparison of the free and
CDP-bound enzymes revealed a movement of the
helical part of the NMPb-insert, in particular helix
a5, towards the ligand (r.m.s.d. due to CDP bind-
ing is 3.17 A
Ê for a5). The same comparison for the
free and CMP-bound enzymes indicates a similar,
but more pronounced closing movement (r.m.s.d.
for a5 is 4.04 A
Ê ). If we also take into account
molecules A and B of dCMP-CMPK, enzyme
conformations from the most open to the most
closed might be classi®ed, according to the position
of a5, as: free E. coli CMPK > dCMP (molecule
B) > CDP > dCMP (molecule A) > CMP. A similar
classi®cation using the other hydroxyl jaw a8 is
less obvious because its C-terminal part (Glu180-
Arg188) is disordered in the absence of a bound
NMP. Anyway, based on the N-terminal part from
a8, which is ordered even in the free enzyme
(Phe171-Lys179),
with
dCMP
the
molecule
B
occupies an intermediate position between the
open structure of the free enzyme and the closed
one induced by CMP, as is the case for the a5-
based classi®cation.
Around 40 different structures are known so far
for various NMP kinases, and much attention was
devoted to the interactions with the phosphate or
the base moieties of their NMP substrates. The
effect of these interactions on the movements of
the NMP binding and LID domains of the enzymes
was thoroughly investigated.11±13 However, the
lack of structural data concerning a model enzyme
able to phosphorylate various NMPs differing in
their sugar moiety hindered discussion about the
pentose contribution. The structures described here
show that in the case of E. coli CMPK the so-called
induced-®t movements seen in the presence of
ligands are not only due to the base or phosphate
moieties of the nucleotides, but also for a large
part to the sugar moiety.
Importance of the 30-OH from the pentose
in catalysis
Kinetic parameters indicate that as opposed to
dCMP, ddCMP is a very poor substrate. This
emphasises the importance of the 30-OH from the
pentose, which is the only chemical difference
between these two deoxynucleotides. The struc-
tures with the natural substrates CMP and dCMP
show two polar interactions with that hydroxyl
group, which have no equivalent in other NMP
kinases of known structure.
The ®rst residue that is H-bonded to the 30-OH
is Arg181 of a8. In contrast, neither AraCMP nor
ddCMP is H-bonded to Arg181, in accordance
with a poor Km. This arginine is highly conserved
in all groups of NMP kinases, and it has been
identi®ed
as
a
residue
involved
in
catalysis.
Indeed, in the structures of UMP/CMP kinase
from Dictyostelium discoideum, an H-bond connect-
ing the equivalent Arg148 to the 30-OH of CMP
was observed in the ``transition state-like'' complex
with CMP, AlF3 and ADP (pdb code 3ukd), but
not in the complex with CMP and ADP (pdb code
2ukd), suggesting that this arginine stabilises the
transition state.8 Except for the complexes with a
transition state analogue, the direct hydrogen bond
we observe between Arg181 from E. coli CMPK
and
the
phosphate
acceptor
is
unprecedented
among NMP kinases. As in the phosphorylation
reaction CMP-CMPK represents a step preceding
the [CMP/g transferred phosphoryl group/ADP]
transition state, this H bond between Arg181 and
the 30-OH is probably productive for catalysis. In
the AraCMP-CMPK structure, no hydrogen bond
connects Arg181 to the 30-OH. However, in the
1106
Sugar Speci®city of Escherichia coli CMP Kinase
case of the R181M variant the kcat for AraCMP is
decreased
by
a
factor
of
40.
This
could
be
explained by a contribution of Arg181 to the tran-
sition state stabilisation.
The second residue that is H-bonded to the 30-
OH of CMP and dCMP is Asp185, again a residue
of a8. This aspartate also makes a polar interaction
with the 20-OH from CMP, AraCMP and CDP. The
bidentate interaction observed for CMP between
the
side-chain
of
a
unique
residue
and
both
hydroxyls
from
the
ribose
has
never
been
described for NMP kinases. Moreover, among
known
structures
of
NMP
kinases
complexed
solely with the phosphate acceptor, a direct protein
interaction with the 30-OH of the sugar only occurs
with thymidylate kinases like TMP kinase of yeast
(pdb coordinates 1tmk14), that phosphorylate 20-
deoxynucleotide substrates: the enzyme residue
involved is also an aspartate, but one from the
phosphate binding loop, that is an N-terminal
domain unrelated to a8 in sequence alignments.
The D185A variant shows a decrease of kcat for the
natural substrates CMP or dCMP. This is also the
case for the AraCMP analogue, a result that
emphasizes the importance of the H-bond between
the 20-OH and Asp185 for this nucleotide. In all
three cases the decrease is even stronger than that
observed for R181M. A decrease of kcat when
Asp185
is
mutated
was
unexpected
from
the
sequence of the E. coli enzyme, as this aspartate
has no equivalent in other groups of NMP kinases.
These results suggest that Asp185, conserved only
in bacterial CMP kinases, also participates in cata-
lysis, possibly through transition-state stabilisation.
Such a stabilisation should involve the interaction
of Asp185 with the 30-OH (see CMP and dCMP(A)
in Figure 2), or for AraCMP with the 20-OH (see
Figure 3) of the sugar. We propose that this
favours a C30-endo conformation, allowing the 30-
OH to interact with Arg181, a residue which can
stabilise the a phosphate. An arginine-phosphate
H-bond is observed in both crystal structures with
CMP and dCMP (molecule A). With AraCMP, we
suggest that Arg181 interacts with the a phosphate
only in the presence of the transition state.
On the whole, the importance for catalysis of the
two residues that are H-bonded to the 30-OH,
Arg181 and Asp185, makes it clear why the cataly-
tic activity of the wild-type enzyme for ddCMP,
that does not possess a 30-OH, is so low.
Understanding the specificity for
20-deoxynucleotide acceptors: the two
conformations observed in crystals with dCMP
With CMP, the two molecules of the crystal
asymmetric unit are essentially identical. With
dCMP, molecule A has a conformation similar to
that with CMP. Compared to CMP, or to dCMP in
molecule A, the dCMP in molecule B: (i) penetrates
less deeply in the binding cleft, (ii) is less tightly
enclosed by the jaws a5 and a8, (iii) lacks the direct
polar interactions with Arg188, and the indirect
one (through Asp185) with Ser101, these three resi-
dues being highly conserved in bacterial CMP
kinases, (iv) does not make any direct H-bond
between the 30-OH from its pentose and Arg181 or
Asp185 of the enzyme, and (v) has a different
sugar conformation (C20-endo instead of C30-endo),
so that it has a very different orientation of its 30-
OH. We can hypothesise that the two alternative
binding modes seen in molecule A (tight binding)
and B (loose binding) coexist in solution. In that
case, the conformer of molecule B, in which the 30-
OH is not oriented as in CMP-CMPK, and there-
fore does not bind the catalytically important resi-
dues Asp185 and Arg181, would be a dead-end
complex non-productive in catalysis. This hypoth-
esis is in accordance with the observed kinetic par-
ameters: the E. coli CMPK activity re¯ected by kcat
remains identical for CMP and dCMP, whereas the
Km of the enzyme for dCMP is about three times as
high as that for CMP, indicating a weaker af®nity
of the deoxynucleotide (Table 2).
The role of Ser101 in dCMP phosphorylation
Bacterial
CMP
kinases
phosphorylate
dCMP
nearly as well as CMP. This is in contrast to
eukaryotic UMP/CMP kinases: for instance, the
kcat/Km ratio for dCMP of UMP/CMP kinase from
D. discoideum is less than 1 % of that for CMP.
Similarly, its kcat/Km for dUMP is around 1 % of
that for UMP (A.M.G., unpublished data). Site-
directed
mutagenesis
of
Ser101
resulted
in
a
variant with a decreased kcat for dCMP. Thus this
serine is important for deoxynucleotide catalysis,
probably through binding of Asp185. This aspar-
tate binds both the CMP and dCMP substrates.
Moreover, crystal structures indicate that it pos-
itions these substrates in a productive way for cata-
lysis: all attempts to get crystal complexes of E. coli
CMPK with the phosphate donor site occupied
(either with ADP, or ATP analogues, or with tran-
sition state analogues with ADP and aluminium
¯uoride) failed; nevertheless, in the structures pre-
sented here the phosphate from CMP or dCMP
points towards a sulphate. In crystal structures of
other
NMP
kinases
also
crystallised
with
ammonium sulphate, such a sulphate occupies a
position corresponding to that of the b phosphate
from the donor ATP.15 The favourable positioning
of the bound substrates is also indicated by the
superposition
of
CMP-CMPK
or
dCMP-CMPK
with structures of other known NMP kinases in
which both phosphate donor and acceptor sites are
occupied.
Thus,
these
E. coli
CMPK
modelled
structures can be considered as structures of the
enzyme with both the NMP phosphate acceptor
and an equivalent of the b phosphate from ATP.
Why does the substitution of Ser101 only slow
down the phosphorylation of dCMP, and not that
of CMP? The crystal structures help to understand
this effect (Figure 2, left): with dCMP (molecule A),
Ser101 interacts with the carboxylate of Asp185
through an oxygen (labelled OD1 on the Figure)
Sugar Speci®city of Escherichia coli CMP Kinase
1107
which is not held in position by any other H-bond,
as in the CMP complex. We suggest that suppres-
sing this interaction by substituting Ser101 with an
alanine results in a more mobile side-chain of
Asp185 when the variant binds dCMP. Moreover,
the partial negative charge of OD1 is no more com-
pensated through hydrogen bonding. In contrast,
the effect of the substitution is minor with CMP as
the 20-OH from the ribose is still H-bonded to
OD1. As Ser101 is conserved in all NMP bind
inserts of bacterial CMP kinases, its role in dCMP
phosphorylation is probably a general feature of
these enzymes.
Possible implications for the design
of antibiotics
Despite the fact that CMPK is not essential for
E. coli, a Gram negative bacterium, mutants devoid
of CMP kinase activity have a decreased DNA syn-
thesis rate and are cold-sensitive.3 However, CMP
kinase appears essential for the Gram positive bac-
terium Bacillus subtilis.16 This raises the possibility
to design new antibiotics against CMP kinases
from bacteria involved in human pathologies. The
four
crystal
structures
presented
here
give
a
detailed image of the interactions between the
E. coli enzyme and phosphate acceptor substrates
differing in their sugar moiety. Together with site-
directed mutagenesis experiments, these structures
also show the involvement of the NMPb-insert
typical of bacterial CMP kinases in dCMP phos-
phorylation, that is a main role of E. coli CMPK.
This gives a wealth of information about enzyme
zones speci®c to bacterial CMP kinases that could
be targeted by inhibitors. Such inhibitors would
avoid possible side effects related to nucleoside
monophosphate kinases of the patients.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
CMP, dCMP and AraCMP were purchased from
Sigma. ddCMP was kindly provided by Dr H.G. Ihlen-
feldt from Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg (Germany).
Site-directed mutagenesis
Replacement by site-directed mutagenesis of Arg181
with a methionine and of Ser101 and Asp185 with an
alanine was performed on the single-stranded form of
plasmid pHSP2102 in the ung dut E. coli strain RZ103217
in the presence of the helper phage M13KO718 and using
respectively the following oligonucleotides: 50-GTTA-
CGGTCGCGGTCGTCCATTTCTTTGATCTC-30, 50-GAA
TGCCGCGACTTGTGCCGCTGCATTCGCCACTTCCTG
-30
and
50-TCGGTTACGAGCGCGGTCGTCGCG-30
(modi®ed codons are in boldface). For overexpression,
plasmids pLA221, pLA224 and pHL90-5a (harbouring
the respective mutated cmk genes) were introduced into
the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pDIA17.19
Purification of the enzymes and activity assays
The overproduced wild-type and modi®ed variants of
E. coli CMPK were puri®ed as described previously,2
and checked by mass spectrometry. Enzyme activity was
determined at 30 C using a spectrophotometric assay.20
For each mutation, both a single-point mutant and its
histidine-tagged (His-tagged) equivalent were produced
and puri®ed. The His-tagged variants were puri®ed by
Nickel-nitriloacetic acid af®nity chromatography21 using
the QIAexpress System. Their kinetic values were essen-
tially the same as those of the non-tagged mutants, indi-
cating that the His-tag did not interfere with catalysis.
As the assays with His-tagged variants were not biased
by
the
potential
presence
of
wild-type
copuri®ed
enzyme, their results are used in Table 2.
Crystallisation
Crystals were grown at 20 C by the vapour diffusion
method,
using
a
6 ml
hanging
drop
with
0.4 M
ammonium
sulphate
in
a
50 mM
Tris-HCl
buffer
(pH 7.4). The wild-type enzyme used for crystallisation
was not histidine-tagged. All crystals were obtained by
cocrystallization of E. coli CMPK (5 mg/ml except for
CMP-CMPK, in which case it was 10 mg/ml) with the
NMP (20 mM for CMP, 10 mM for dCMP and ddCMP,
40 mM for AraCMP). Concentrations of ammonium sul-
phate in the pit were 1.7 M with CMP and AraCMP,
1.1 M for dCMP, and 1.3 M for ddCMP. Crystals were
allowed to grow for several weeks before data collection.
Their
typical
size
was
around
0.2 mm  0.2 mm 
0.2 mm,
except
with
dCMP
(0.1 mm  0.05 mm 
0.05 mm). All crystal systems are orthorhombic, space
group P212121, with two molecules per asymmetric unit.
Data collection
All crystals were frozen at 100 K before data collec-
tion, using paraf®n oil (Hampton Research) as cryopro-
tectant.
Data
were
collected
on
the
European
Synchrotron
Radiation
Facility
(ESRF)
in
Grenoble,
France, beamline BM-30A (FIP) for CMP-CMPK and
dCMP-CMPK crystals, beamline ID14-2 for ddCMP-
CMPK crystals, and on the synchrotron of LURE (Orsay,
France), beamline DW32, for AraCMP-CMPK crystals.
All data were processed and scaled with the DENZO
and SCALEPACK programs.22 Information for all useful
data collection and processing is given in the upper half
of Table 1.
Phasing
The
structures
of
CMP-,
dCMP-,
ddCMP-,
and
AraCMP-CMPK complexes were solved by molecular
replacement at 3.5 A
Ê
resolution with AMoRe,23 using
only the protein part of the CDP-CMPK model. In all
cases a clear density immediately appeared for the NMP.
Model building and structure refinement
Models were built using the O program.24 CNS25 ver-
sion 1.0 was used for re®nement, which was monitored
using a free R factor.26 With the nucleotide analogues
pseudo-merohedral
twinning
problems
occurred:
for
ddCMP-CMPK, we collected data for several crystals
until obtaining an untwinned one; for AraCMP-CMPK,
all data sets we collected were twinned with very close a
1108
Sugar Speci®city of Escherichia coli CMP Kinase
and b unit cell parameters, mimicking a tetragonal crys-
tal system. Thus, re®nement could only be achieved
using SHELX 97-227 on the ®rst steps, CNS being used
for the ®nal steps with the re¯ection ®le corrected by
SHELX.
In all cases, simulated annealing was initially used, as
well as non-crystallographic constraints. Then the two
molecules of the asymmetric unit were re®ned as differ-
ent models, using individual B factors. In the ®nal steps
we placed water molecules in residual density above 2.5
standard deviations. Solvent molecules with B factors
re®ning higher than 60 A
Ê 2 were discarded. For each
model, side-chains from a few residues (zero to six per
molecule) had no clear density and were modelled as
alanines. A summary of the re®nement results together
with model statistics is given in the lower half of Table 1.
Superposition of different structures
Models
were
superposed
with
the
procedure
implemented in O, and the relevant root mean square
deviations for Ca atoms were calculated using CNS. As
residues Arg70 to Val80 have a weak density in all struc-
tures, the corresponding region was omitted in r.m.s.d.
calculations.
