A NAD+-dependent medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon
Aeropyrum pernix K1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The recombinant enzyme
was a homotetramer of molecular mass 1.6102 kDa. The optimum pH for the oxidative reaction
was around 10.5 and that for the reductive reaction was around 8.0. The enzyme had a broad sub-
strate specificity including aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, aliphatic and aromatic ketones, and
benzylaldehyde. This enzyme produced (S)-alcohols from the corresponding ketones. The enzyme
was thermophilic and the catalytic activity increased up to 95C. It maintained 24% of the origi-
nal catalytic activity after incubation for 30 min at 98C, indicating that this enzyme is highly
thermostable.

Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are widely distributed
in nature and have been found in many animals, plants and
microorganisms (1). They play important roles in a broad
range of physiological process (1, 2). ADHs are generally
subdivided into three groups (3), the medium-chain zinc-
dependent ADHs (approximately 350 amino acids per sub-
unit) such as horse liver ADH (4) and ADHs (isozymes I–
III) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5), the short-chain zinc-
independent ADHs (approximately 250 amino acids per
subunit) such as ADH from Lactobacillus brevis (6), and the
long-chain iron-activated ADHs (approximately 385 amino
acids per subunit) such as ADH IV from S. cerevisiae (7).
ADHs catalyze the reversible oxidation of alcohols to the
corresponding aldehydes or ketones. ADHs catalyzing the
stereospecific reduction of carbonyl groups have been dis-
covered in different organisms. For example, ADHs from
Rhodococcus erythropolis (8) and Thermoanaerobium brockii
(9) produce (S)-alcohols, and ADH from Lactobacillus kefir
(10) produces (R)-alcohols. Optically active alcohols are
important building blocks in the synthesis of a broad variety
of natural compounds and drugs. However, many ADHs are
generally unstable and the low stability often hampers their
industrial application.
Recently, ADHs from thermophilic organisms have been
isolated. These ADHs are thermostable and have broad sub-
strate specificity (9, 11–16). In this report, we describe the
purification and characterization of a zinc-containing me-
dium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase from the hyperthermo-
philic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix K1 (17), of which struc-
ture was recently solved (18, 19). We report that this en-
zyme is highly thermostable, and has a broad substrate spec-
ificity and high enantioselectivity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of an expression vector for ADH from A. pernix
K1
A shot-gun clone (A2GR7175) containing an alcohol dehy-
drogenase coding sequence (ORF: APE2239) was used as a tem-
plate for PCR amplification. An N-terminal primer, 5-CCGGGGT
ACCATATGAGAATAGAGCAAGACTTCTCGC-3 and a C-ter-
minal primer, 5-CCCCCAAGCTTGGATCCGTTACGGTATCAG
GACTGCCC-3, containing NdeI and BamHI sites (underlined in
the sequences), were used. The fragment generated was gel-puri-
fied. This purified gene was digested with NdeI and BamHI and
ligated into the pET-11a vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA, USA)
digested with the same restriction enzymes. The plasmid, pET-
11aapADH, was cloned and verified by DNA sequencing after
transformation of Escherichia coli XL10-Gold with the ligated
product.
Expression and purification of apADH
A single colony of
E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET-11aapADH was inocu-
lated into 5 ml of LB media containing 50 g/ml of ampicillin at
37C. At OD6600.8, 50% (v/v) glycerol solution was added to the
culture (20% glycerol, final concentration) and this glycerol mix-
ture was stored at 80C until use. Ten l of the glycerol solution
was added to 10 ml of LB media containing 50 g/ml of ampicillin
and incubated at 37C. At OD6600.8, the culture was added to 1 l
of TB media containing 100 g/ml of ampicillin and the cells were
grown overnight (15 h) at 37C.

The cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was
resuspended in 50 ml of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH
7.2) containing 0.1 mM AEBSF (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and
disrupted by sonication at 4C. The lysate was centrifuged and
the supernatant was incubated first in the presence of Benzonase
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; 40 units/ml of solution) and 6 mM
MgCl2 for 3 h at 37C, and then in the presence of protamine sul-
fate from salmon (Sigma; 1 mg/ml of solution) at 4C for 30 min.
After the nucleic acid fragments were removed by centrifugation,
the supernatant was heated at 60C for 45 min. In addition, after
centrifugation, the supernatant was heated at 75C for 45 min, and
the precipitated host proteins were removed by centrifugation. The
supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.2).
Saturated ammonium sulfate solution was added to the dialyzed
enzyme to a final concentration of 50% saturation. The suspension
was stirred for 30 min and then centrifuged. Solid ammonium sul-
fate was added to the resulting supernatant to a final concentration
of 80% saturation. This mixture was stirred again and centrifuged
as above. The resulting pellet was dissolved in a minimal volume
of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and dialyzed against
the same buffer.
The dialyzed enzyme was applied to a CIM QA disk column
(123 mm; BIA Separations, Ljubljana, Slovenia) which had pre-
viously been equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The column was
eluted with 60 column volumes of a linear gradient of 0–0.3 M
KCl in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The fractions
that showed ADH activity were pooled and concentrated by ultra-
filtration with a PLHK membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
The concentrated enzyme was applied to a Superdex 200 HR
10/30 column (130 cm; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ,
USA), and then eluted with 1.25 column volumes of 50 mM po-
tassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mM potassium
chloride. The fractions containing apADH were concentrated by
ultrafiltration.
Enzyme assay
The catalytic activity of apADH was deter-
mined at 60C by monitoring the increase or decrease in absor-
bance at 340 nm (3406.22 mM–1 cm–1), which is the characteristic
absorption wavelength of NADH. The oxidation reaction mixture
(2 ml) contained 0.18 mol NAD+, alcohol, and 0.2 nmol purified
apADH in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The re-
duction reaction mixture (2 ml) contained 0.16 mol NADH, alde-
hyde or ketones, and 0.2 nmol purified apADH in 100 mM potas-
sium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Except when measuring the ther-
mal activity, the reaction was initiated by the addition of an appro-
priate amount of coenzyme.
pH profiles of initial reaction rates
The initial rates of the
alcohol dehydrogenase reaction in both the oxidative and reductive
directions were measured as a function of pH, from 3.8 to 11.5, us-
ing potassium citrate, potassium phosphate, glycylglycine–KOH,
and glycine–HCl buffers. For the alcohol oxidation reaction assay,
a 2.0 ml solution of an appropriate buffer (100 mM) with 100 nM
apADH, 90 M NAD+ and 40 mM 2-pentanol was used. For the
ketone reduction reaction assay, a 2.0 ml solution of an appropriate
buffer (100 mM) with 100 nM apADH, 80 M NADH and 40 mM
2-pentanone was used.
Thermal activity and stability
The thermal activity of
apADH was assayed at temperatures between 30C and 95C. The
reaction mixture was composed of 90 M NAD+, 3.8 mM 2-pen-
tanol and 100 nM apADH in 2.0 ml of 100 mM potassium phos-
phate (pH 8.0). The reaction was initiated by addition of 20 l of
the mixture of apADH and NAD+.
The stability was studied by incubating apADH (4 M) in 50
mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.2 containing 150 mM KCl at
various temperatures. After incubation for 30 min, each sample
was placed on ice and centrifuged at 4C. The residual activity was
assayed by the oxidation of 3.8 mM 2-pentanol under the reaction
conditions described in the enzyme assay section.
Kinetic constant measurements
All the reactions followed
Michaelis–Menten type kinetics under the appropriate experimen-
tal conditions. The Michaelis constant (Km) and catalytic turnover
(kcat) were determined for each substrate summarized in Tables 1
and 2 with 90 M NAD+ or 80 M NADH depending on the type
of reaction studied. The kcat and Km values for NAD+ and NADH
were determined using 3.8 mM 2-pentanol and 10 mM 2-penta-
none as the substrate, respectively. Other conditions were same as
in the enzyme assay section.
Determination of enantiomeric excess
The reduction of ali-
phatic ketones was conducted with cofactor regeneration at 60C
for 24 h. The reaction mixture contained 60 nmol NADH, 30 mol
ketone, 300 mol cyclohexanol (for NADH regeneration) and 0.6
nmol purified apADH in 3 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 8.0). Chiral gas chromatography equipped with a flame
ionization detector was used to determine the enantiomeric excess.
All the samples were extracted with CH2Cl2 and were derivatized
with trifluoroacetic anhydride. An aliquot (approximately 1 l) was
applied on a CHIRALDEX G-TA column (25 m0.25 mm I.D.;
Advanced Separation Technologies, Whippany, NJ, USA).
RESULTS
Enzyme expression and purification
The recombi-
nant apADH (ADH from A. pernix K1) was successfully
expressed in E. coli without induction. The purified apADH
gave a single band on SDS–PAGE. The molecular mass of
apADH calculated from the gene sequence was 39.57 kDa
and that obtained in the SDS–PAGE analysis was 40 kDa.

The molecular mass of the native apADH was estimated as
1.6102 kDa by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200
HR 10/30), suggesting a tetrameric structure in aqueous so-
lution.
Effect of pH on apADH activity
The effect of pH on
the initial reaction rates of apADH was investigated for the
oxidation of 2-pentanol and the reduction of 2-pentanone
(Fig. 1). The optimal pH for the oxidation was around pH
10.5, while that for the reduction was around pH 8.0. The
initial rate of the oxidation was about 18-fold faster than
that of the reduction measured in buffers at the respective
pH optimums.
Thermal activity and stability of apADH
The effect
of temperature on the activity of apADH is shown in Fig. 2.
The reaction rate increased up to 95C. An Arrhenius plot
showed no obvious transition point between 30C and 95C.
The activation energy for oxidation of 2-pentanol was cal-
culated to be 127 kJ mol–1.
The thermal denaturation of apADH was monitored by
the activity after incubation for 30 min at different tempera-
tures (Fig. 3). The activity was completely maintained up to
75C, after which its activity gradually decreased.
Substrate specificity of apADH
The substrate speci-
ficity of apADH in the oxidative reaction was studied using
a range of alcohols, including aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic
alcohols (Table 1). For aliphatic linear chain alcohols, a
broad range of primary alcohols were oxidized by apADH.
The Km values decreased as the alkyl chain became longer.
Similarly, in secondary alcohols, apADH preferred alcohols
with long alkyl chains. The highest kcat was found with 2-pen-
tanol (0.60 s–1). For aromatic alcohols, the Km values be-
came smaller as the alkyl chain length increased. Therefore,
it appeared that alcohols with long chains were preferable
substrates.
The substrate specificity of apADH in the reductive re-
action was examined using a range of ketones including
aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones, and benzylaldehyde
(Table 2). For aliphatic ketones, the Km values decreased as
the alkyl chain became longer. The highest kcat was found
with 2-hexanone (1.08 s–1). Therefore, it seemed that aro-
matic ketones were not good substrates for apADH. For ex-
ample, it was hard to quantify the reduction rate of aceto-
phenone due to the very small substrate conversion.
Enantioselectivity 
Table 3 shows the enantioselec-
tivity of apADH for various aliphatic ketones. This enzyme
preferably reduced aliphatic ketone to (S)-alcohol. The val-
ues of the enantiomeric excess increased with the increase
of chain length except for the reduction of 2-hexanone. The
highest enantioselectivity was showed with the reduction of
2-nonanone.
DISCUSSION
In thermophilic archaea, several kinds of ADHs have been
discovered. The ADH from Pyrococcus furiosus (11) is a
short-chain ADH, while those from Thermococcus litoralis

PROPERTIES OF A. PERNIX ADH
VOL. 97, 2004 
205
(12), Thermococcus strain ES-1 (13), Thermococcus hydro-
thermalis (14), Thermococcus strain AN1 (20), and Pyro-
coccus furiosus (21) are long-chain ADHs. Medium-chain
ADHs have been discovered in Sulfolobus solfataricus (15,
22) and Sulfolobus strain RC3 (23). apADH (ADH from
A. pernix K1) is a medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase.
This enzyme is a homotetramer with a molecular mass of
1.6102 kDa, while the S. solfataricus ADH was found to
be a homodimer with a molecular mass of approximately 70
kDa (15).
Similar to many ADHs, the optimum pH for the oxidation
reaction was higher than that for the reduction reaction (8,
12, 14, 16, 24, 25). In the oxidation reaction, the pH profile
showed a narrow peak in the alkaline region and less than
20% of its maximum activity below pH 9.0. Similar results
were found for the NADPH-dependent long-chain ADH from
T. hydrothermalis (14). In the reductive reaction, apADH
showed catalytic activity in a broader pH range compared to
the oxidative reaction. It showed more than 20% of its maxi-
mum activity between pH 6.0 and 10.2.
apADH was thermophilic and thermostable. Similar to S.
solfataricus ADH, which has been known as the most ther-
mostable medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (15) iden-
tified so far, the initial activity of apADH increased up to
95C. However, apADH is more stable than S. solfataricus
ADH. apADH maintained 24% of the initial activity after
incubation for 30 min at 98C, while S. solfataricus ADH
lost 90% of the original activity after incubation for 30 min
at 95C (22). Guy et al. also examined the thermostability
of apADH and reported that this enzyme had a half-life time
for activity of over 2 h at 90C (19), while that of 30 min at
90C was observed in our study. This inconsistency may be
caused by the difference in experimental conditions, how-
ever, which were not shown at all in the previous report.
Consequently, apADH is now the most thermostable me-
dium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase reported to date.
apADH shows broad substrate specificity and prefers ali-
phatic alcohols and ketones. Concerning the apADH prefer-
ence for alcohols, there were no large differences in the re-
activities between primary and secondary alcohols. The Km
values decreased with longer chains, and the higher values
for the kcat/Km ratio were obtained for 1-hexanol and 2-nona-
none. apADH prefers long-chain aliphatic alcohols and ke-
tones. As for other ADHs from thermophilic bacteria, P.
furiosus ADH and T. brockii ADH prefer secondary alco-
hols than primary alcohols (11, 26), while T. litoralis ADH
and S. solfataricus ADH prefer primary alcohols (12, 15).
The highest catalytic activities of P. furiosus ADH, T. litora-
lis ADH, and T. brockii ADH were found with C4, C6, and
C5 alcohols, respectively (11, 12, 26).
The kcat values for aromatic ketones were small, while
those for aromatic alcohols were larger than those for ali-
phatic alcohols. Acetophenone, in particular, was not esti-
mated due to the low reaction rate, while benzaldehyde,
which has the acetophenone structure without the methyl
group, was a preferable substrate.
apADH reduced aliphatic C8–C10 ketones to (S)-alcohols
with high enantioselectivity. The enantioselectivity of T.
brockii ADH is explained by ‘two-site’ model with a large
and a small binding pockets (9). This model cannot explain
that the enantioselectivity for 2-hexanone was lower than
that for 2-pentanone, while the high enantiomeric excess of
long-chain ketones seems to fit this model. Since cyclohex-
anol is one of good substrates, a large and a small binding
pockets of apADH might not be definitely separated.
No ADHs from hyperthermophilic organisms that show
enantioselectivity have been reported to date. Some ADHs
from thermophilic bacteria, which are less stable than ADHs
from hyperthermophilic organisms, showed high enantio-
selectivity (9, 27, 28). However, these ADHs are dependent
on NADP(H) that is rather expensive than NAD(H). Valu-
able properties of more inexpensive cofactor NAD(H)-de-
pendent apADH such as thermal stability, reversibility, broad
substrate specificity and high enantioselectivity will make
this enzyme one of potential biocatalysts for industrial chiral
aliphatic alcohol syntheses.
